Thesis: 
Animals only control a range of 
motion with the eyes; a prime number
 (pN) of motion ðŸ”» is subconscious
 and controls where exactly our
 eyes will target or end. 

F(x) = pN/ðŸ”»

There are wave function patterns
 that are used most when our eyes
 begin to move,sustain a direction, 
and end in motion.

The motion of the eyes is reminiscent of an ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) wave controller in time. A human can start the movement of the eyes however controlling where they will end up stopping on becomes more subconsciously controlled. 
F(ðŸ”») = [1/A, 1/D, 1/S, 1/R]

This thesis explains why accidents
 occur in motion.

This thesis also provides wave
 functions to prevent accidents 
in motion.


EXPERIMENT
build a shelf

place any objects on shelf

cover the shelf and objects

ask a subject to look at an unveiled shelf

T = target, track exactly how the aubject moves their eyes

d = track what direction the subject moves their eyes

t = time including time since first not le was pressed to the end of the release and the end of a sound.

T = A+D+S+R+t

w = the waveform of the sound

w = A+D+S+R

T = d+w+t

track the motion if the eyes in space on a x y z axis and use line graphs to track the motion of the eye in 3d space.

try to detect the concious control from the subconcious eye movements.

create a binary between concious and subconcious.

ask a subject to move their eyes to different objects and images.
