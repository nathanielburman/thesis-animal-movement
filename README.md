Thesis: 
Animals only control a range of motion with the eyes; a prime number (pN) of motion ðŸ”» is subconscious and controls where exactly our eyes will target or end. 

F(x) = pN/ðŸ”»

There are wave function patterns that are used most when our eyes begin to move,sustain a direction, and end in motion.

The motion of the eyes is reminiscent of an ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) wave controller in time. A human can start the movement of the eyes however controlling where they will end up stopping on becomes more subconsciously controlled.

This thesis explains why accidents occur in motion.

This thesis also provides wave functions to prevent accidents in motion.
